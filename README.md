iMovie - Lite
iMovie - Lite is a simple web application that allows users to manage and play audio tracks. 
It provides a user-friendly interface for handling audio files and offers various features to enhance the user experience.

Features:
Adding Audio Tracks:
Users can add audio tracks to the application in two ways:
  Upload Audio Files: Users can upload audio files directly from their local storage by clicking the "Choose File" button and selecting the desired files from the file browser.
  Record Audio: Users can record audio directly from their device's microphone by clicking the "Start Recording" button. Once the recording is complete, users can save the recorded audio track, which will be added to the list of tracks.


Deleting Audio Tracks:
Once audio tracks are added to the application, users have the option to delete individual tracks from the list. 
Each audio track displayed in the interface is accompanied by a "Delete" button, which, when clicked, removes the corresponding track from the list.

Playing Audio Tracks:
iMovie - Lite allows users to play audio tracks individually. Each track displayed in the interface is equipped with a "Play" button. Users can click this button to initiate playback of the selected audio track.
Users can also speed up/slow down the audio tracks by selecting the option at the right of the progress bar.

Playing All Audio Tracks:
Users can play all audio tracks sequentially by clicking the "Play All" button. 
This feature enables users to enjoy continuous playback of all audio tracks added to the application, providing a seamless listening experience.

Technologies Used:
iMovie - Lite leverages the following technologies to deliver its functionality:

React: The frontend of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture enables the creation of modular and reusable UI components.

HTML & CSS: The structure and styling of the application are implemented using HTML and CSS. CSS is used to define the visual appearance and layout of the user interface elements.

JavaScript: JavaScript is used to implement the logic and interactivity of the application. Event handling, state management, and data manipulation are performed using JavaScript.

File API: The File API is utilized to handle file input for uploading audio tracks. It enables the application to interact with files selected by the user and extract relevant information such as file names and content.

React Hooks: State and side-effects within React components are managed using React Hooks such as useState and useRef. These hooks provide a concise and efficient way to handle component state and access DOM elements.

Media Element API: The Media Element API is employed to control audio playback within the application. It provides methods and properties for interacting with audio and video elements, allowing for tasks such as starting, pausing, and seeking playback.
